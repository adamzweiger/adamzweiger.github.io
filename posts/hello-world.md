## Hello World
##### July 23, 2024

I've been finding myself getting pretty bored this summer here at my internship, away from MIT and the [Desmond](http://desmond.mit.edu/) family. Outside of work, climbing, reading, and cooking, my days have been quite inactive. It's amazing how much extra time there is when I don't spend my evenings psetting or surrounded by my way-too-much-fun dormmates. But, one of the good thing about taking a break from the firehose of MIT and spending time alone is that I can collect my thoughts! I hardly have any time for that during the semester. So, I created this blog!

I hope to post here, when I have time, about my life, some technical notes as I learn more about math/CS/AI, and other topics in philosophy, culture, tech, etc as I find interesting.

### Why start now?

It's surely not the first time I've been bored alone, nor the first time I've tried to write down my thoughts, but I've never before actually had a blog. For a while, I've been reluctant to post writing for others to see because whenever I looked at my attempts or those of my peers, whether it be college essays or blog posts or anything else, I always cringed at the mundanityâ€”the lack of originality in substance or the immaturity in style. 

Indeed, it's *hard* to really find substantive things to say with the relatively small number of unique life moments, pieces of media read, and amount of technical research/experience that most 18 year olds have. We've all had the same trite self reflections after our first year away from home; we've all read *The Great Gatsby* in school and can relate it to current economic disparities; we can all give our speculations on whether AI will kill us all. Young peoples' training sets share great overlap, and are very limited compared to those of good writers or scientists. 

This was kind of a bottleneck for me because whenever I wrote something down, I thought to myself that someone has written about this already, what's the point. In a self reflection of my own, I've come to accept that *that's totally fine." It is OK to write about things that have already been written, do things that have been done. We are all still beginning our journeys towards becoming good writers, still starting to learn about our chosen fields. Putting oneself out there and posting one's pure thoughts is both worthwhile to get better at writing and truly commendable, no matter the quality of the writing or if it's been done many times before. It's like how billions of people have taken a picture of the sunset, but still, when you see a really nice one, your instict is to go get your own shot. It's slightly different from everyone else's, and more importantly, it's your own!

So, I will be writing more about things that've already been thought, . Obviously, I still think one's writing should be as novel as possible, but I'm not going to badger myself about how someone's already done it.

<!-- This line of thinking has slowly warmed me to the idea of posting writing online, and so here we are! -->
