# Creating and Defeating Hexhunt
##### August 30, 2024

This HackMIT admission cycle, we ran HackTimes, a NYT-times games themed series of puzzles, mostly CTF-style.

Here, I’ll explain my puzzle and a few good ways to solve it.

### Motivation
This puzzle came about after I played a good game of Word Hunt with a friend. Word Hunt …

A natural question came up - what’s the best board of word hunt you can get? 

### Evaluation
“Anything you can evaluate perfectly is essentially solved”

Use a trie to represent the wordlist.

### Search
Now, we get to the crux of the problem. How do we maximize a function over a search space that’s too large?

Genetic algorithms

mini complete search

gradient ascent

Simulated Annealing
