## On Writing
##### July 23, 2024
---
I've been finding myself getting pretty bored this summer here at my internship, away from MIT and the [Desmond](http://desmond.mit.edu/) family. Outside of work, climbing, reading, and cooking, my days have been quite inactive. It's amazing how much extra time there is when I don't spend my evenings psetting or surrounded by my way-too-much-fun dormmates. But, one of the good thing about taking a break from the firehose of MIT and spending time alone is that I can collect my thoughts! I hardly have any time for that during the semester. So, I created this blog!

I often recall the many writers and inventors of history who had their greatest revelations in periods of prolonged boredom. Thoreau, writing Walden out in his remote cabin in Massachusetts; Orwell, who wrote 1984 on a remote Scottish island; and Newton, developing calculus while quarantined during a wave of the Black Death. It can't be the worst thing to try to follow their footsteps and attempt to be creative while bored alone! Of course, countless others have done their greatest work while surrounded all around by fellow unique thinkers, so perhaps I shouldn't think too much of it. But I digress. 

I hope to post here, when I have the time, about topics in philosophy, culture, tech, etc as I find interesting and technical notes as I learn more about math, CS, and AI.

### Why start only now?

It's not the first time I've been bored alone and started trying to write down my thoughts, but this time something is different. For a long time, I've been hesitant to start writing down my thoughts for others to see because whenever I looked at my attempts or those of my peers—college essays, blog posts, etc—I usually cringed at the mundanity—The lack of originality in substance or the immaturity in style. 

Indeed, it's *hard* to find really substantive things to say with the relatively small number of unique life moments, pieces of media read, and amount of technical research/experience that most my age possess. To use the language of artificial intelligence, young peoples' training sets share great overlap, and are very limited compared to those of great writers or scientists. We've all had similar self reflections after our first year away from home; we've all read *The Great Gatsby* in school and can relate it to current economic disparities; we can all give our speculations on whether AI will kill us all. 

*But that's totally fine*. In a sophomoric self reflection of my own, I've come to accept that it is OK to not be unique. We are all still beginning our journeys towards becoming good writers, still starting to learn about our chosen field. Putting oneself out there and writing one's pure thoughts is both worthwhile to get better and truly commendable, no matter the quality of the writing or if it's been done many times before. This realization has slowly warmed me to the idea of posting writing, and so here we are.

<I'll be Forgiving!>



All of us have read truly great works of fiction that left us in awe, brilliant, A lot of young people's blogs contain uninteresting posts about their lives, trite self-reflections, and overwritten sentimentality. Those that do attempt to write about "interesting" topics often lack the cultural capital of older writers.





Writing is exploration. It is exploration of the writer's own mind, a solitary period of intrinsic examination, akin to meditation. It challenges the writer to truly confront and articulate what she is thinking, and articulation is the highest form of understanding. Stephen King once compared writing to telepathy,

We've, more or less, all read *The Great Gatsby* in school and can relate it to the boom of silicon valley wealth. We've all seen *Everything Everywhere All at Once* and can go on for pages about how great it was as a film about optimistic nihilism.

I'll strive to not be too much of a cornball on this blog, but will accept that 

I'm currently 18 years old. Nearly every other 18 year old American whose writing you or I will have encountered was likely exposed to a lot the same literary works in school, the same movies, and the same teenage conversations that shape the substance of a person's writing. To use the language of artificial intelligence, young peoples' training sets share great overlap, and are terribly limited compared to those of great writers. 

However, such an attitude 


Great writers are often people who have both unique personal experiences on top of having read a great number of works that have already been written. 

Often, this personal experience takes the form of life struggles that they've gone through. J.R.R. Tolkien, 

lived through unique experiences, specialized in an area  and who has read the great 

The young people who *have* been exposed to unique life experiences, often 

When I look at pieces of writing today from young people, I see a few categories they fall into. First, there are journalism articles and , the ones you see in the NYT or Washington Post which all sounds the same. The editorial process produces decent writing, but removes any individual style or life. The writing is merely communication of information. There is nothing wrong with this sort of writing, in fact it is good to have a standard so readers consistently are able to understand and 


When I look back at the great writers of history, at the sheer brilliance of those who have come before,

Starting to write. Looking back at the great writers, of the great ideas that have been thought


We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time


I hope to write about philosophy, culture, CS, AI, and more.

Good writing is poetic but formal.
